Description: Facilitates easy analysis of factorial experiments, including
    purely within-Ss designs (a.k.a. "repeated measures"), purely between-Ss
    designs, and mixed within-and-between-Ss designs. The functions in this package
    aim to provide simple, intuitive and consistent specification of data analysis
    and visualization. Visualization functions also include design visualization for
    pre-analysis data auditing, and correlation matrix visualization. Finally, this
    package includes functions for non-parametric analysis, including permutation
    tests and bootstrap resampling. The bootstrap function obtains predictions
    either by cell means or by more advanced/powerful mixed effects models, yielding
    predictions and confidence intervals that may be easily visualized at any level
    of the experiment's design.
